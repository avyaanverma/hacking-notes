# Server Message Block - SMB 

**SMB (Server Message Block)** is a network file sharing protocol primarily used for sharing access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It operates over port **445** (and in some cases, port 139) and is commonly used on Windows networks but can also be configured on Linux systems via Samba.

Here’s how to connect to SMB, and check for open ports:

### 1. Connect to SMB from Command Line
To connect to an SMB share on Windows, use the `net use` command:

```powershell
net use \\<hostname_or_ip>\sharename /user:<domain_or_username> <password>
```

Example:

```powershell
net use \\192.168.1.10\shared_folder /user:mydomain\myusername mypassword
```

This will map the SMB share, and you can then access it like a regular drive.

### 2. Check SMB Port (445) with PowerShell

To check if SMB port 445 is open, you can use **PowerShell** with the `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet, which tests network connectivity for a specific port. Here’s the command:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname_or_ip> -Port 445
```

Replace `<hostname_or_ip>` with the IP address or hostname of the server you want to check. If the port is open, the result will show `TcpTestSucceeded: True`. If it’s closed, you’ll see `TcpTestSucceeded: False`.

### Additional Information on SMB:

- **Versions**: There are several versions of SMB. Windows uses SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3, but SMBv1 is deprecated due to security vulnerabilities (it’s recommended to disable SMBv1).
- **Linux**: You can connect to SMB from Linux using the `smbclient` command, or by mounting SMB shares with `mount -t cifs`. 

Let me know if you’d like more details on SMB configuration or troubleshooting!

SMB is a protocol because it defines a standardized way for devices to communicate over a network to share resources like files, printers, and other services. A protocol ensures that both the client (e.g., your laptop) and the server (e.g., a remote PC on the VPN) “speak the same language,” so they can interpret each other’s requests and responses effectively.

Let’s break down **how SMB works** and **how you can visualize SMB traffic**:

### 1. Why SMB is a Protocol

As a protocol, **SMB standardizes interactions** between networked devices, allowing them to perform complex operations (like file transfer, printer sharing, etc.) without requiring custom code for each connection. Protocols like SMB help devices:
   - Establish connections
   - Authenticate users
   - Send structured requests for files, folders, and services
   - Provide responses (like requested files, error codes, etc.)

### 2. How SMB Works

When your laptop sends an SMB request to a remote PC over a VPN, the process generally follows these steps:

1. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Your laptop initiates a connection to the server's IP address over port **445** (or port **139** if NetBIOS over TCP/IP is being used).
   - The SMB client (your laptop) negotiates with the SMB server to agree on an SMB version (e.g., SMBv2 or SMBv3).

2. **Authentication**:
   - Your laptop sends authentication credentials (e.g., username and password).
   - The SMB server verifies these credentials. If successful, it grants access to the shared resources.

3. **Resource Request**:
   - Once authenticated, your laptop can send requests to access specific resources. This could include listing directories, reading files, writing files, or opening a shared printer.

4. **Response from the Server**:
   - The SMB server processes the request and sends a response. This could include the requested data (like file contents) or a status code if the request cannot be fulfilled.

5. **Data Transfer**:
   - Data transfers over the VPN connection, where SMB manages the request/response cycle to maintain the session and ensure data integrity.

6. **Session Termination**:
   - Once done, your laptop will close the connection with the SMB server to free up resources.

### 3. Visualizing SMB Traffic

To visualize SMB traffic, you can use **Wireshark**, a popular network protocol analyzer that captures and displays packets sent and received over the network. Here’s how you can visualize SMB requests:

#### Steps to Capture SMB Traffic in Wireshark:

1. **Install Wireshark**:
   - Download and install Wireshark if you haven’t already.

2. **Set Up a VPN Connection**:
   - Connect your laptop to the VPN, making sure that you can access the remote PC via SMB.

3. **Start a Capture**:
   - Open Wireshark and start a new capture on the network interface associated with your VPN connection.

4. **Filter for SMB Traffic**:
   - To focus on SMB, apply a display filter in Wireshark:
     ```plaintext
     tcp.port == 445
     ```
   - This filter will show only traffic on port 445, which is commonly used by SMB.

5. **Initiate SMB Activity**:
   - Perform some SMB actions on your laptop, like connecting to a shared folder on the remote PC or transferring a file. This will generate traffic that Wireshark can capture.

6. **Analyze SMB Packets**:
   - Look for packets with the **SMB** protocol in Wireshark. These packets contain details about the SMB session setup, authentication, file requests, and responses.
   - You can examine each packet to see what kind of requests are being made, the files accessed, or any errors returned by the server.

#### Key SMB Packets in Wireshark:
   - **Negotiate Protocol Request/Response**: This packet shows the initial protocol negotiation.
   - **Session Setup**: Shows the authentication process between client and server.
   - **Tree Connect**: Indicates access to a specific shared resource on the server.
   - **File Operation (e.g., Open, Read, Write)**: Shows specific actions performed on shared files or directories.

### Why Visualization Matters

Visualizing SMB traffic is helpful for:
   - **Troubleshooting**: Identifying failed connections, permissions issues, or malformed requests.
   - **Security Analysis**: Detecting unauthorized access attempts or monitoring sensitive data transfers.
   - **Performance Tuning**: Finding bottlenecks in data transfer rates or connection issues across VPNs.

By following these steps, you can monitor SMB traffic in real-time and gain a deeper understanding of how SMB requests travel over your VPN to a remote PC.
